# Pleased to meet you!

My name is Ashley Bonner. My current role is a Manager of Evidence Synthesis and Data Analytics at Eversana. I work with a team of 20+ statisticians to develop and execute statistical analyses of clinical and real-world data.

I specialize in the synthesis of data and comparison of interventions through meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, and other indirect treatment comparison techniques. I am developing expertise in survival analysis techniques for extrapolating long-term probabilities of survival.

My educational background includes a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics, followed by a Ph.D. in Health Research Methodology & Biostatistics at McMaster University in Canada. 

I'm an aspiring programmer with over 15 years experience in R.
